# Contributing to whisperdesk

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository is intentionally minimal so you can pick a stack later. Until then, please follow these simple guidelines.

## Ground rules

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Update docs when behavior changes.

## Branching

- Use short, descriptive branch names:
  - `feat/<scope>-<short-title>`
  - `fix/<scope>-<short-title>`
  - `chore/<scope>-<short-title>`

## Commits

- Prefer Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add X`, `fix: correct Y`, `docs: update Z`).
- Write clear, imperative messages.

## Pull requests

- Fill out the PR template (summary, changes, testing, screenshots if applicable).
- Include tests when you add behavior (once a stack is chosen).
- Request review when ready.

## Code of Conduct

TBD. If you adopt one, link it here.
